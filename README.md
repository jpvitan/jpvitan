# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Justine Paul Vitan, a software developer who loves to build fast and responsive applications for multiple platforms. I currently do full-stack development and native app development for iOS and Android.

Aside from the usual software development stuff, I'm also interested in CS theory, cryptography, deep learning, and amateur astronomy. I sometimes write blogs in my spare time to share my knowledge about a specific subject or topic that interests me.

In this age of "big data," my next objective is to advance and expand my knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence and develop applications that take advantage of this technology.
